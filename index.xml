Bergson’s duration-based view of time is an intrinsically transcendental view of time, and a rejection of clock time; its transcendence is reflected in the conceptual nature of time consciousness on the one hand, and in the account of the “simultaneity of duration” on the other. Bergson’s theory of duration in Time and Free Will distinguishes between spatialized time and pure duration, and argues that the latter cannot be descripted through language or science, and is therefore susceptible to the problem of dichotomy between private consciousness and publicness.</description></item></channel></rss>

Female, as a special kind of absolute other, a passive and welcoming figure, is constructed over a transcendental and metaphysical femininity in Lévinas’s early works. Lévinas criticizes Heidegger’s “being-toward-death” for its supreme masculinity, returns to Bergson, and ponders temporality in an ethical way, pointing out it is based on a face-to-face relationship, an irreciprocity of “my time” and “the time of the other as other.</description></item><item><title>Henri Bergson</title><link>https://2.shu-l.in/docs/bergson/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://2.shu-l.in/docs/bergson/</guid><description>From Duration to Simultaneity: Henri Bergson’s Time Theory # The article explores Bergson’s philosophical reflection on time.

Bergson’s theory of duration in Time and Free Will distinguishes between spatialized time and pure duration, and argues that the latter cannot be descripted through language or science, and is therefore susceptible to the problem of dichotomy between private consciousness and publicness.</description></item></channel></rss>
